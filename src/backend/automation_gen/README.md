# Automation Generation

This package contains all the modules to disassemble a loaded automation configuration and create a list of all its entities. Additionally, a Python script is created that can imitate the functionality of the automation and thereby determine the outputs of variable inputs such as triggers or conditions.

The `automation_gen` package is responsible for generating automation scripts and  the list of contained entities.
It consists of multiple scripts, each contributing to a specific part of the automation process.

The `config_dissection.py` script is the bundling of all sections and enables the holistic creation of an automation
with its entities as well as an executable automation script.
