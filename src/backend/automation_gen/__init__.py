# The `automation_gen` package is responsible for generating automation scripts and  the list of contained entities. 
# It consists of multiple scripts, each contributing to a specific part of the automation process.

# The `config_dissection.py` script is the bundling of all sections and enables the holistic creation of an automation
# with its entities as well as an executable automation script.
