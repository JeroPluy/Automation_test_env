# Testing

To run the test scripts in the [`./src/test`](https://github.com/JeroPluy/Automation_test_env/tree/main/src/test) directory,
the Python path of the virtual environment for the terminal in which the script is called must be changed. 
The following command can be used for this.

```shell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "..\\src"
```
