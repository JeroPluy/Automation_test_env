# Frontend

> **Usage Information:**
>To run the frontend scripts in the [`./src/frontend`](https://github.com/JeroPluy/Automation_test_env/tree/main/src/test) directory, you must first follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/JeroPluy/Automation_test_env/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). After you set up your environment you can proceed with the running of the scripts.
>
> If you encounter any import issues when running the test scripts, you may need to change the Python virtual environment path for the terminal where the program is called .
>The following command can be used for this, if your root directory is the automation_test_env directory.
>
> ```shell
> $env:PYTHONPATH = "..\\src"
> ``

## The Current Status

The frontend is currently still under construction. The various components and their implementation can already be examined in [`frontend_tryout.py`](https://github.com/JeroPluy/Automation_test_env/blob/main/src/test/frontend_tryout.py) The preliminary application can be found in [`frontend/test_environment_app.py`](https://github.com/JeroPluy/Automation_test_env/blob/main/src/frontend/test_environment_app.py).

## Usage

The application can be run by running the [`test_environment_app.py`](https://github.com/JeroPluy/Automation_test_env/blob/main/src/frontend/test_environment_app.py) file. Only one application can be open at a time.
